To Do
=====
> Interior shadows flicker when Light LOS checks are turned on
	>> Occurs when the light source is set to flicker (z.B a candle) and the projection translation momentarily kills LOS
> Prevent shadows from being culled when outside the camera frustum
	>> only when they are close to the player
> Look into the dark shadow issue - precision or LOD?
